# Create and Read Friends

## Objectives:
* Create a Flask application that displays data from a MySQL database
* Take user input and add it to the database
* Practice redirecting after going to a POST route

Create an application that allows users to view all friends and add new ones.

Have the main page show all users and their data as part of a table. On the same page, allow users to enter data and submit that data to the database in order to add a new friend. How many routes do you need? What should each do? Think back to routing from the previous section, and remember never to render from a post route (once you're done building the features you need).
