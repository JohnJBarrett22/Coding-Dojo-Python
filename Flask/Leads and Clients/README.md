From the previous MySQL activity, you had an assignment where you needed to do some complex queries for leads/sites/customers.  On this assignment, we want you to create a simple report dashboard like below using jQuery charts and graphs:

You should pull appropriate information from the database to generate the table and the graph.  Once you retrieve all the information for 'all time', then allow the user to change the reporting date range by adjusting the two dates on the top right.  This assignment can be a bit difficult but teaches a lot of great lessons that could save you lots of time later when you're working on real complex projects.
