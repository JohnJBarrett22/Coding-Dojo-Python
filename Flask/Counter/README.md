# Counter

## Objectives:
* Practice using session to store data about a particular client's history with the app
* Be able to check whether a session exists
* Be able to initialize a session
* Be able to modify a session

Build a flask application that counts the number of times the root route ('/') has been viewed. 

This assignment is to test your understanding of session.

As part of this assignment, please start with the following features first:
* localhost:5000- print in the terminal what's stored in session as well as have it render a template.
* localhost:5000/destroy_session - clear session (e.g. session.clear()).  Once the session is cleared, redirect to the root.
* Add a +2 button underneath the counter that reloads the page and increments counter by 2. Add another route to handle this functionality.

## Ninja Level 2
Add a reset button that resets the counter back to 1. Add another route to handle this functionality.
