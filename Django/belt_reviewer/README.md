# Belt Reviewer

Before you work on the belt reviewer assignment below, please make sure you are able to address the following questions.  If you're on-site, it's strongly encouraged that you go through these list of questions with someone else in your cohort.

## Additional practice (optional)
This assignment is optional and if you haven't already finished all the mandatory assignments, you should finish them first before working on this assignment.  Most likely if you were able to build the wall and felt comfortable with the assignments, you'll do fine with the belt exam.  If you do want additional preparation, please feel free to work on this assignment but be aware that as soon as you take your belt exam, you're expected to immediately start working on your project.

Using the below wireframe, create a Django application where logged in users can view and add book reviews. A user should also be able to delete his/her own reviews.
