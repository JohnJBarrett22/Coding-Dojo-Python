1.) Know how to retrieve all users.
    User.objects.all()




2.) Know how to get the last user.
    User.objects.last()




3.) Create a few records in the users
    User.objects.create(firstname="John", lastname="Barrett", email="johnjbarrett22@gmail.com", age="36")
    User.objects.create(firstname="Christina", lastname="Barrett", email="baybeeboo19@gmail.com", age="36")
    User.objects.create(firstname="Alyssa", lastname="Barrett", age="3")


4.)Know how to get the first user.
 
    User.objects.first()


5.)Know how to get the users sorted by their first name (order by first_name DESC)
    User.objects.order_by("firstname").values("firstname")




6.)Get the record of the user whose id is 3 and UPDATE the person's last_name to something else. Know how to do this directly in the console using .get and .save.
    j = User.objects.get(id=3)
    j.firstname = "Susan"
    j.save()


7.)Know how to delete a record of a user whose id is 4 (use something like User.objects.get(id=2).delete...).
    User.object.get(id=4)
    j.delete()

(optional) Ninja:
8.)Find a way to validate the data coming in to the shell.  For example, make sure that "name" fields are a minimum length, "email" is a valid email, or that "email" doesn't already exist in the db.
    We could just use Django's built in validators, though the prefrerred method would be through our own code that we will transition from view.py into models.py..
