# Books/Authors

Create a new app called 'book_authors' in the same project where you did the previous assignment: Dojo Ninjas.  You'll use this assignment as well as the previous assignment to learn about Ajax.

Please do the following
* Create a new model called 'Book' with the information above.
* Create a new model called 'Author' with the information above.  Design the models in a way that you could perform the following:
* Book.objects.first().authors
* Author.objects.first().books
* Successfully create and run the migration files

Using the shell...
* Create 5 books with the following names: C sharp, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby
* Create 5 different authors: Mike, Speros, John, Jadee, Jay
* Add a new field in the authors table called 'notes'.  Make this a TextField.  Successfully create and run the migration files.

Using the shell...
* Change the name of the 5th book to C#
* Change the first_name of the 5th author to Ketul
* Assign the first author to the first 2 books
* Assign the second author to the first 3 books
* Assign the third author to the first 4 books
* Assign the fourth author to the first 5 books (or in other words, all the books)
* For the 3rd book, retrieve all the authors
* For the 3rd book, remove the first author
* For the 2nd book, add the 5th author as one of the authors
* Find all the books that the 3rd author is part of
* Find all the books that the 2nd author is part of
