# Login and Registration

Rebuild the Login and Registration assignment from the flask chapter, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.

### Build the following:
* Show validation error messages if validations fail the following tests
* First Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
* Last Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
* Email - Required; Valid Format
* Password - Required; No fewer than 8 characters in length; matches Password Confirmation
* Bonus: Birthday Field - Before today, or go creative and do it in an age range
* Bonus: Implement Flash Messages

One thing we've noticed as people build their login and registrations that you should consider:

### User.objects.get(email = email)
If there is not a matching email for a .get(), Django throws an error (try and except could come in handy), otherwise it returns the User object associated with the matching user. e.g. Userobject.

### User.objects.filter(email = email)
Filter, on the other hand, returns a list, so if there is no user that matches, it returns an empty list.  If there is a single matching user the list will contain a single User object: e.g. [Userobject].
